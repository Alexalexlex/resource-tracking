Resource Tracking System for LLM Integration

Modern IT companies often use microservice architectures, which can introduce new challenges when integrating Large Language Models (LLMs).
One of the key issues is high resource consumption — LLMs can demand significant computational and network resources, impacting overall system performance.

Solution: Resource Tracking System

The Resource Tracking System solves this problem by monitoring and analyzing all traffic between the LLM service and any connected microservice.
This allows you to:<br>
	•	Track requests and responses between services.<br>
	•	View metadata for every LLM interaction.<br>
	•	Analyze resource usage and team activity through a visual UI dashboard.<br>
	•	Set usage limits or define quotas based on your team’s needs.<br>

Benefits<br>
	•	Gain full visibility into LLM usage across your organization.<br>
	•	Identify bottlenecks and optimize resource allocation.<br>
	•	Control costs by limiting unnecessary requests.<br>
	•	Support data-driven decisions for scaling and improvement.<br>
